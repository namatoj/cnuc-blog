I really wanted to like COBOL.

When listening to people on podcasts talking about COBOL they seem to really like it because how good it is on what it does good, and it is supposed to be easy to learn.

- The historical interest
- Myths about COBOL
  - You can make good money
- What COBOL is really good at
- The failure
  - The commecial interest, i.e. IBM
  - The optionality standard
  - The difficulty
- Conclusion
  - I don't have the patience for that
