I recently went to an event where many decisions needed to happen and where consensus was important. With this backgound a person introduced a consensus voting mechanism developed to be effective in reaching consensus.

## The process

First a proposal is presented to be voted on. Then there are four actions to take in a voting round.

1. **Agreement** This is signalled by raising your hand.
1. **Counterproposal** This is signalled by raising your fist.
1. **Question** This is signalled by raising a finger.
1. **Indifference** This is signalled by your palm facing the ground.

If someone has a question, then the question is asked and answered and a new voting round is made.
If someone has a counterproposal then the proposal is presented and a new voting round is started based on the new proposal.
If everyone is in agreement or are indifferent, a decision has been made.
